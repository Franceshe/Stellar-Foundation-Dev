# Stellar-Foundation-Dev

## Interesting Features Stellar Network provide:
### 1-1 Token relationship
* Similar to how banks issue real cash money and and electronic credit.
Stellar also issues a 1-1 mapping of token and any currency of interests.
However, only token would be moved computationally and real cash/credits
stays in bank. Thus the auth-authen-transfer-verification process won't be 
process through bank network but Stellar network.

## Systen Architecture:
* At the lowest level, Stellar is a system for tracking ownership. 
* ledgers are verified and updated, every five seconds.
* A unique algorithm, called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), keeps 
everything in sync.
